            <h2>Here's a time line of Nikola Tesla's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1856:</strong> Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, in Smiljan, now part of Croatia.</li>
                <li><strong>1884:</strong> Tesla arrived in New York City with little more than a letter of
                    recommendation for Thomas Edison, leading to his early work in the U.S.</li>
                <li><strong>1887:</strong> Tesla patented his induction motor and began promoting alternating current
                    (AC) power systems.</li>
                <li><strong>1888:</strong> Tesla entered into a contract with George Westinghouse, who adopted Tesla’s
                    AC system and made significant investments in its development.</li>
                <li><strong>1891:</strong> Tesla invented the Tesla coil, a device used to generate high-voltage,
                    high-frequency alternating current.</li>
                <li><strong>1893:</strong> Tesla demonstrated wireless lighting and power transmission at the World’s
                    Columbian Exposition in Chicago, showcasing his AC technology.</li>
                <li><strong>1895:</strong> Tesla’s AC system was used to generate electricity at the Niagara Falls Power
                    Plant, marking a significant milestone in electrical engineering.</li>
                <li><strong>1901:</strong> Tesla began construction of the Wardenclyffe Tower on Long Island, intended
                    for wireless communication and power transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>1904:</strong> Tesla was granted a patent for a radio transmitter, which laid the groundwork
                    for future radio technology.</li>
                <li><strong>1915:</strong> Tesla was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics, alongside Thomas Edison,
                    for his contributions to the development of electrical engineering.</li>
                <li><strong>1920:</strong> Tesla published various papers and gave lectures on wireless power
                    transmission, discussing potential applications for global energy distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>1943:</strong> Nikola Tesla passed away on January 7 in New York City, leaving behind a
                    legacy of groundbreaking inventions and contributions to science and technology.</li>
            </ul>
